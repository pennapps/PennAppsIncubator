We’d like to hear about your idea whether it is a hack, a functional minimum viable product, or anywhere in-between! Penn student startups are welcome to apply from <INSERT DATE> to <INSERT DATE>. As a startup in our incubator program, you will receive dilution-free funding on an as-needed basis. Additionally, startups will receive consulting from the PennApps team in software development, design, and business modeling.

The incubator program will consist of weekly meetings that will alternate between business-oriented lectures and check-ins where you will be delivering updates and have the opportunity to receive support if needed. We will also plan to host entrepreneurs and venture capitalists as guest lecturers. Lastly, startups will be able to demo their product at the PennApps fall hackathon to generate sales, gain exposure, and receive feedback from the global community of hackers.
